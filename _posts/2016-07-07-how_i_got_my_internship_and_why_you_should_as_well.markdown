So tonight I am going to write a different type of post than my normal coding post. I have had an internship for the last couple weeks and it was the best thing that I could have done for myself, and of course time will tell this, but I feel like it will be an amazing thing for my career as well.

The most important thing that you can do is go to meetups. I was attending several local programming meetup groups that were way, way, way over my head. I stuck through them though because even if I was only picking up a couple things, these were a couple things that I could use and implement. The other thing that I was excited about, was that I got to see professional programming environments. Since I am a giant tool nerd, I quickly learned that I loved Atom thanks to these meetups and have been using it for months now. 

Anyways, I was persistent in meeting people after the talks were over. I told everyone that I was a newb and still showed them my code and what I was building, and one guy offered me the opportunity to come into his workplace for a code review if I ever needed it. I thought it was very nice of him, but being a new programmer I was nervous about it and I didn't take him up on his offer.

Well a month went by and I went to another meetup and met with this same guy again. I showed him how far along I was coming and he offered the code review again, and also introduced me to his boss. His boss took me into their office and showed me around and said that if I would like there is an extra desk and he would love for me to come in occasionally and work if I wanted too. Well again being shy and scared to show off my code, I avoided going in. There were a couple times that I almost took him up but I didn't for a month.

Another month, and yet another meetup, and I met up with both gentlemen again, and the owner approached me. He said "When are you going to come into the office to work?". I told him that I wasn't sure and that I would someday. This part cracked me up and will always stick with me, he said to me, "No let me rephrase my question, what day and time this week will you be in the office?". So needless to say, he didn't really give me a choice!

I made the commitment to him, showed up the time we agreed upon, and he decided that we would just make it an internship. I got to read all their policy and process docs, signed a NDA, and my official internship was up and running. I was able to look at production level code! A lot of it is still way above my head, but they have me doing code reviews, and I am even starting on an intern project in my free time while I am not working on Learn. That is the other awesome thing about them, they are letting me spend as much time in the office as I want and I am able to work on Learn full time there. 

It is amazing to see how professionals work on a daily basis. How much pair coding that they do, and also how overly willing they are to answer any questions that I may have. The other exciting thing to me is that in this group, most of the people are all bootcampers. It is amazing to me to see that because there is always the stigma of "Am I doing the right thing by not going to college?". Let me tell you based on my company, that yes we are definitely doing the right thing by learning through a coding bootcamp.

Let me say this, please do yourself a favor and go out to meetups. Meet as many people as you can, and dont be afraid to show off what you have done. Also ask people for an internship and be persistent about it. Do not do like I did and be too scared to go into it if one is offered to you. The people there will be amazing and almost always willing to help when you get stuck. Plus you get to say that not only are you a bootcamper, or even, a self taught learner, that you are also an intern for an awesome software company. That will look incredible on a resume and they will teach you software development flow and you will get to see how production level code is handled.

The last thing that I want to say is this, don't be discouraged if you dont get a job out of your internship. The company just might not be in a position to hire a junior. Remember that you are gaining invaluable experience that you will be able to show other employers. You will get to open projects that have a pull request guidline template, sprints that are meaningful, plus a whole test suite if you did your job right. This will get you hired, this and your schooling!
