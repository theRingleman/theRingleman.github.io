## My Family

I will start this out by saying that I am new daddy! My Daughter Cadee was born 9 months ago and truly is a miracle, we almost lost her at birth. I have been married for almost six years now to the greatest woman that any man could be lucky enough to call their partner. These two ladies are my reason for living, as well as my journey into coding.

I started learning to code like a lot of people, through HTML. I remember I went to Barnes and Noble and bought a book on HTML and CSS so I could customize my MySpace page. I didn't really run with it but I would say that it planted that seed. I eventually graduated high school and started college where I decided that I was going to be a computer science major. I took some intro to CS classes and I was less than amused. The very first class that I took was supposed to be about learning concepts of coding, boolean logic, if statments, and loops. Everything was fun, we were writing psuedo code and it seemed very interesting. Well after a short intro with psuedo code our instructor thought that it would be a good idea to have us all start writing Java as our first language... Not JS but vanilla Java. **So, I am not a fan of Java...** Although I admit that isn't fair and that amazing things have been created with this language, it didn't really fit my educational needs as a first language. 

I eventually met my wife got married and got my first big boy job as a salesman. I was very rapidly told that I was not allowed to pursue college and that I had to focus strictly on my career. I complied, after all I was married and I had a family that I needed to look after. So while I was at that job, I started a blog and tried to break into the internet world becuase I hated that job. My blog attempt did not succeed, mainly becuase I was not passionette about what I was writing and therefore I was not consistent in my writing, but I still learned a lot about wordpress and CSS.

I eventually found a job working with BNSF Railway. I am an engineer for them, and no not your typical engineer, I was the guy that went through your town at three in the morning blaring my horn and waking your children... Sorry about that. Needless to say it was a fantastic job, but I always had my computer on me and I continued trying my hand at coding. I did Codecademy, Treehouse, Code School, Khan Academy and many others. Nothing ever really seemed to stick with me though. 

While at BN, my wife and I had our daughter and we were sure that everything was going to be ok. We were set, I had a great paying job, the family was growing, and everything seemed perfectly good. Well January 1st of this year was when I finally got caught up in the layoffs. I had a brand new daughter, a wife working more than she should, and I was the stay at home parent thanks to political and economic ceicumstances. I started looking into work from home opportunities and I decided that I was going to learn how to transcribe. I was going to make a living doing that until the BN called me back. 

I was talking with a family member and telling him about my plans to transcribe and he asked me why would I do such a thing. He told me that he was learning to code and was training to be a front end developer and that I could get access to the courses and we could work through everything together. So he set me up with the courses he was taking and we started getting together weekly. We went through several courses on Udacity and started planning to start a web design company. Well the more that we got into coding, the more we recoginzed that we didn't neccessarily want to design websites, we wanted to build web apps. I started looking into a lot of different bootcamps Around the Northern Colorado area and none of them really grabbed my attention. 

One night I couldn't sleep and I was trying to figure what exactly I wanted to do about my journey into code. I stubled upon a blog that was talking about the Flatiron School and for some reason I decided to click through and check out what this was all about. The first night I requested the curriculum and read through everything, I was impressed, just not $1000 a month impressed. Yet my curiousity was still peaked so I signed up for the intro to Ruby to test the platform. It seemed as though they developed this curriculum for me. So I blasted through the intro in four days and signed up the next day. 

So here I am. A father, a husband, and a student. Looking to go into a completely different career path for my life. But I feel this is where I am meant to be. I have always wanted to use my laptop as a tool rather than just for consumption. Now coding is all I think about. I read books on code, I watch TV shows about code, I even listen to the Code Newby Podcast in my car wherever I go (unless my wife is in the car, she thinks I am nuts). But I am on this journey to pursue a dream, and give my family the kind of life that they deserve!

Thank you Flatiron for giving me a proper path on learning to code! I hope to build some great things!
